-----------------------------------



I am a graduate in Physics from the University of Bath 🏛 , working in scientific research for over 3 years 🔬. Having started my career in radiation analysis, I quickly evolved into programming, working on data science and performance 💻. 

Joined Github **2** years ago (unofficially) but only started my personal projects Git recently... The purpose of this GitHub is to have a place to show the other projects I am beginning to work on.

### Talking about Personal Stuffs:

- 🛠 &nbsp; I’m currently working with Python, utilising frameworks like dash and flask for web dev.
- 🔨 &nbsp; Current professional work includes performance computing with CPU and GPU hardware.
- 🌱 &nbsp; I’m currently learning things like Full Stack Development as well as database management.
- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; Most of my (non-work related) projects are available here [Github](https://github.com/jamesdidathing).
