-----------------------------------

I am a graduate in Physics 🎓 from the University of Bath 🏛 , working in the world of scientific research 🔬 for over 3 years! Having started my career in radiation analysis ☢️, I quickly evolved my passion into programming 💻 and haven't looked back.

Joined Github **2** years ago (unofficially) but only started my personal projects Git recently...

### Talking about Personal Stuffs:

- 🛠 &nbsp; I’m currently working with Python, utilising frameworks like dash and flask.
