-----------------------------------

I am a graduate in Physics from the University of Bath 🏛 , working in scientific research for over 3 years 🔬. Having started my career in radiation analysis, I quickly evolved into programming, working on data analysis and performance 💻. 

Joined Github **2** years ago (unofficially) but only started my personal projects Git recently... The purpose of this GitHub is to have a place to show the other projects I am beginning to work on.

### Talking about Personal Stuffs:

- 🛠 &nbsp; I’m currently working with Python, utilising frameworks like dash and flask.
- 🌱 &nbsp; I’m currently learning things like Full Stack Development as well as database management.
- 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp; Most of my (non-work related) projects are available here [Github](https://github.com/jamesdidathing).
- 📫 &nbsp; How to reach me: jamesalexhodson@gmail.com.
